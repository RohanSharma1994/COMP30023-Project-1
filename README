Compilation instructions:
Typing "make" should build the project.

If there is any problems running the project:
You can use the following command (just copy + paste in terminal (must be in project directory)):
gcc -Wall -o memswap memswap.c fit_algorithms.c ready_queue.c memory.c -lm

All the documentation for the functions are in their respective files, and the file structure is described below:

memswap.c: Main file which acts as a facilitator
memswap.h: A header file for memswap.c
memory.c: This file includes all functions which can be used to simulate memory using linked lists.
memory.h: A header file for memory.c
ready_queue.c: This file includes all functions which can be used to simulate a ready queue for processes.
ready_queue.h: A header file for ready_queue.c
process.h: Defines the structure of the process used in this simulation.
fit_algorithms.c: This has 4 different functions for fitting algorithms {best,first,next,worst} fit.
fit_algorithms.h: This is the header file for fit_algorithms.
Makefile: The Makefile for this project.
report.txt: My report for part B.
